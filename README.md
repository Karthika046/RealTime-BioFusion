# RealTime-BioFusion
A real-time bio signal monitoring system capturing ECG, EEG, and EMG using BIOAMP, Arduino, and ESP8266. Signals are amplified, filtered, and wirelessly streamed for MATLAB/XGBoost processing, enabling feature extraction, noise reduction, fatigue detection, and multi-parameter physiological performance evaluation.
